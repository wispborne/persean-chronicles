## Karengo's Galactic Adventures ##
## Part 1: Dragons ##
#### Stage 1: Bar Event ####
dg_dr_stg1_prompt=The moment you pass through the bar door, a strong-smelling drink is pressed into your hand. You look at it, dumbfounded, and then look up to the waiter who gave it to you. "Compliments of Mr. Karengo," he says, nodding his head towards a crowd of people, mostly young men, before moving on.
dg_dr_stg1_startBarEvent=Head over to "Mr. Karengo"
dg_dr_stg1_pg1_onShown=As you make your way over, you note that nearly everyone in the bar has the same drink you do. In the middle of the crowd, a large, heavily muscled man with extensive tattoos is gesticulating wildly, apparently telling a story.
dg_dr_stg1_pg1_opt1=Go listen to the man
dg_dr_stg1_pg1_opt2=Leave
dg_dr_stg1_pg2_para1="...so then he asks me, 'Have you ever ridden one?' And I look back at this crazy joithead and I say, 'You're a crazy joithead.' But he's got me thinking, y'know? Nobody has ever ridden one. Least, not nobody that could talk after." He lets out a sharp laugh, then raises his voice. "So I ask you all; who wants to join Karengo to make history? Who wants to ride a dragon? I'll supply the jetpacks, you supply the courage!"
dg_dr_stg1_pg2_para2=You've heard the stories of the dragons flying through ${dragonPlanet}'s skies as a child. Great beasts; graceful and dangerous, the apex predators of the air, they are strikingly similar to the dragons described in ancient legends. The Persean Sector is host to many dangerous creatures, and these living myths hold a place near the top of that list.
dg_dr_stg1_pg2_para3=A cheer goes up from the men, especially the drunk ones. Karengo starts to hand out death and accident waivers and to collect money for the expedition. Suddenly, his expression darkens and he cocks his head, listening to his earpiece. "Listen up!" he yells, "Seems my regular pilot got in the way of some disreputable folk! We need ourselves a ship and a captain to bring this lot to ==${dragonPlanet}==! Who's brave enough? Who else wants to make history?"
dg_dr_stg1_pg2_opt1="Captain ${playerLastName}, at your service. We leave at dawn!"
dg_dr_stg1_pg2_opt2=Stay silent
dg_dr_stg1_pg3_onShown=You wake up significantly after dawn with empty bottles and unconscious men strewn all over the ship's mess hall. Karengo peels himself off the floor and offers you a crooked smile, shielding his eyes from the light. "Alright, ${playerLastName}," he says, "let's do this."
dg_dr_stg1_pg3_opt1=Leave

#### Intel ####
dg_dr_intel_title=The Dragonriders
dg_dr_intel_title_failed=\ - Failed
dg_dr_intel_title_completed=\ - Completed
dg_dr_intel_subtitle_stg1=Take the group to the ==${dragonSystem}==
dg_dr_intel_subtitle_stg2=Return the group to ==${startPlanet}== in the ==${startSystem}==
dg_dr_intel_desc_para1=A lively man named Karengo and a few passionate youth are traveling with you to see the draconic animals on ==${dragonPlanet}== in the ==${dragonSystem}==.
dg_dr_intel_desc_stg2=Return to ==${startPlanet}== in the ==${startSystem}==.
dg_dr_intel_desc_stg3=The surviving men were returned home, having gotten more adventure than they bargained for.
dg_dr_intel_desc_stg-failedByAbandon=You abandoned the Dragonriders to their deaths on ${dragonPlanet}. They will never fly again.
#
#### Stage 2: Arrival at planet ####
dg_dr_stg2_pg1_para1=The men load into a shuttle and Karengo directs you down through the atmosphere of ${dragonPlanet}${ifColonized}. As you're putting down in a clearing halfway up a mountain, you hear an otherworldly screech and your ship lurches violently to one side. You would have been thrown to the floor if you hadn't been strapped in.
dg_dr_stg2_pg1_para1_ifColonized=, steering clear of the usual tourist areas and, you realize, of the local law enforcement
dg_dr_stg2_pg1_para2="Look lively, lads!" shouts Karengo, the only person still standing. "Your chariot awaits!" He double-checks the jetpacks on the backs of each of the men, or "Dragonriders", as they creatively branded themselves during their first night of the voyage, then opens the side hatch and hurls the Dragonriders out the door before jumping himself.
dg_dr_stg2_pg1_para3=After the group has left, you land - this time undisturbed - and pull up every external camera you have to watch the action.
dg_dr_stg2_pg1_opt1=Continue
dg_dr_stg2_pg2_para1=The dragons of ${dragonPlanet} you learned about on the "Xenofauna and Flora" channel were different from the dragons of mythology, but the beasts you see today aren't quite what you learned about, either. For one, the creatures flying outside your window are largely invisible - a trick of the way the light reflects around the scales on their hides. They are faster, too, or perhaps the ones on the show had been drugged to make them easier to film.
dg_dr_stg2_pg2_para2=A quick survey of the scene shows that Karengo has tagged three dragons with some sort of harmless marker gun to make them easier to track. Eight of the Dragonriders are chasing the largest one, which is missing part of a tooth and has blackened scales from where it hit your shuttle's shield. The last Dragonrider is nowhere in sight.
dg_dr_stg2_pg2_para3=Suddenly, proximity sensors go off on the starboard side and a camera shows something - or someone - bounce off your shield and tumble down the mountain.
dg_dr_stg2_pg2_opt1=Announce that you're leaving
dg_dr_stg2_pg2_opt2=Stay and watch the Dragonriders
dg_dr_stg2_pg2_opt3=Take off, leaving everybody else behind (leave)
dg_dr_stg2_pg3_para1=Checking your camera feeds again, you see that object rolling down the hill is indeed a body. On another monitor, one of the Dragonriders is keeping just above a dragon, attempting to lower himself down. The dragon rolls in midair, its wing catching the man and sending him flying out of control. Fortunately, a leafy tree branch prevents any further physical harm. Meanwhile, a second dragon is pursuing another one of the Dragonriders.
dg_dr_stg2_pg3_opt1=Get everyone out of there
dg_dr_stg2_pg3_opt2=Take off, leaving everybody else behind (leave)
dg_dr_stg2_pg-abandon_para1=The ship takes off with a roar at your touch. Between the cries of the dragons, the sound of the engines, and the air rushing past, you can barely hear the fear and betrayal in the voices of the men you've left behind.
dg_dr_stg2_pg-abandon_opt1=Exit
dg_dr_stg2_pg4_para1=You turn on the external speakers. "We are leaving!" you blast to the survivors, "Get on board!"
dg_dr_stg2_pg4_para2=The defeated Dragonriders need no further encouragement. They beeline for the hatch and you flicker the shield to let them on deck, where they collapse, wide-eyed and panting. Karengo isn't with them. You turn to ask about him, when a flash of motion on a monitor catches your eye.
dg_dr_stg2_pg4_para3=Karengo is there, and he's riding a dragon, gripping the ridge of scales around its neck. The dragon is frantically trying to get him off, but deft application of his jetpack is, for now, keeping him on top of the beast. He lets out wild whoops of triumph as they soar through the sky and at last you can understand the appeal of this whole expedition. Your admiration is cut short by two catastrophic crashes on either side of the ship and accompanying sirens. The dragons are trying to get through.
dg_dr_stg2_pg4_opt1=Take off (leave)
dg_dr_stg2_pg4_opt2=Swear and take off (leave)
dg_dr_stg2_pg4_opt2_para1="Pignuts," you mutter to yourself.
dg_dr_stg2_pg5_para1=The ship takes off quickly enough to make you light-headed. "Get on board!" shouts one of the men over the external speakers. You position the ship just below Karengo and lower the shields. Scales bounce off the roof like diamonds. Karengo releases his grip on the dragon and free falls toward you, slowing at the last possible moment before dropping through the top hatch and landing in a crouch. You flick on the shields and hit the engines, hard. They respond enthusiastically, rocketing you away from the mountain${ifColonized}. From the cabin comes the sound of back-slapping and, surprisingly, a sob.
dg_dr_stg2_pg5_para1_ifColonized=\ and into the safety of patrolled airspace
dg_dr_stg2_pg5_opt1=Take the men back home
#
#### Stage 3: Back Home ####
dg_dr_stg3_pg1_para1=As you land and fuel up, Karengo herds the seven surviving men out of the ship. "Meet us at the bar, yeah?" he says to you. "This day deserves a celebration." You nod, but can't help but notice red eyes and wet cheeks among the rest of the Dragonriders as they shuffle off.
dg_dr_stg3_pg1_para1_ifHostile=You land at a remote location, where the authorities are unlikely to track you down, and Karengo herds the seven surviving men out of the ship. "Meet us at the bar, yeah?" he says to you. "This day deserves a celebration. And " You nod, but can't help but notice red eyes and wet cheeks among the rest of the Dragonriders as they shuffle off.
dg_dr_stg3_pg1_opt1=Continue
dg_dr_stg3_pg2_para1=Later that day, you spot the Dragonriders at a corner table of the bar. The men, with the exception of Karengo, appear subdued.
dg_dr_stg3_pg2_para2="How goes it, ${playerLastName}?" he asks. "We were just raising a glass to mission success - made possible by you, of course. Great flying, ${playerBrotherOrSister}." The bartender arrives with a round of drinks and Karengo raises one. "To the Dragonriders!" he says.
dg_dr_stg3_pg2_opt1="To the Dragonriders!"
dg_dr_stg3_pg2_opt2="To our fallen friends!"
dg_dr_stg3_pg2_opt2_para1=Karengo gives you an unreadable look and lowers his glass.
dg_dr_stg3_pg2_opt3="I'm good, thanks."
dg_dr_stg3_pg2_opt3_para1=Karengo gives you an unreadable look and lowers his glass.
dg_dr_stg3_pg3_para1="Your payment, plus Bolek and Jarek's signup fees. ==${rewardCredits}==."
dg_dr_stg3_pg3_opt1="Thanks."
dg_dr_stg3_pg3_opt2="I can't accept their money. It's not right."
dg_dr_stg3_pg3_opt2_para1=Karengo shrugs and doesn't take it back.
dg_dr_stg3_pg4_para1="Maybe I'll see you again sometime, yeah? I'm in need of a pilot with some guts." He nods in your direction, clearly dismissing you.
dg_dr_stg3_pg4_para1_opt1=Leave
