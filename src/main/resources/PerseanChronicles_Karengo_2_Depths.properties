dg_de_intel_title=Karengo's Galactic Adventures
dg_de_intel_title_completed=Karengo's Galactic Adventures - Completed
dg_de_intel_subtitle_stg1=Bring Karengo and crew to the ==${depthsSystem}==
dg_de_intel_subtitle_stg2=Bring Karengo${ifCrewAlive} back to the ==${depthsSourceSystem}==
dg_de_intel_subtitle_stg2_ifCrewAlive=\ and crew
dg_de_intel_desc_stg1=The adventurer Karengo and five others are traveling with you to ==${depthsPlanet}== in the ==${depthsSystem}==. He mentioned going underwater and something about a "quoijuu".
dg_de_intel_desc_stg2=Return to ==${depthsSourcePlanet}== in the ==${depthsSourceSystem}==.
dg_de_intel_desc_stg3=You found a crashed Gate Hauler deep in the oceans of ${depthsPlanet} and salvaged it as best you could. A strange crystal formation is ==boosting drug production== on ==${depthsPlanet}== in the ==${depthsSystem}==.
#
#### Stage 1: Bar Event ####
dg_de_stg1_prompt=A boisterous laugh sounds from somewhere behind you. You haven't heard that voice since your ship was attacked by dragons.
dg_de_stg1_startBarEvent=Look around for Karengo
dg_de_stg1_pg1_para1="${playerFirstName}!" A huge hand claps you on the shoulder and spins you around, putting you face to face with the large man and his wide grin.
dg_de_stg1_pg1_para2="Remember me? You're the best pilot I've had - that stunt to get us out of ${dragonPlanet}, right out of the dragon's nest? Epic."
dg_de_stg1_pg1_para3=A sign behind him reads, 'Karengo's Galactic Adventures'. Sketches decorate the space around the text and you can make out refractive dragons, a glowing yellow fish eye, and unfamiliar blue ships trailing blue mist.
dg_de_stg1_pg1_para4="Like it?" Karengo follows your gaze. "Decided to make this an official thing. Well...an unofficial official thing.\nNo need to involve governments. Doesn't matter; I need a pilot again, and a good one. You've got a waterproof lander, right?"
dg_de_stg1_pg1_opt1="Uh, yeah. I think so."
dg_de_stg1_pg1_opt2="Of course."
dg_de_stg1_pg1_opt3="Sorry. You'll have to find another pilot."
dg_de_stg1_pg2_para1=Karengo laughs. "Those landers are made to handle anything, it'll be fine. I've got a group of lads and ladies here rarin' to see some quoijuu in heat, right up close'n'personal. They've all got their own subpods, so how's about we load up and head out in the next few hours. Good? Good."
dg_de_stg1_pg2_para2="Oh, nearly forgot. We're headed to ==${depthsPlanet}==, in the ==${depthsSystem}==. Ain't sure who's in charge over there these days, so we might need to grease some palms. Best to keep your eyes open and shields up."
dg_de_stg1_pg2_opt1="We leave at noon!"
#
#### Stage 2: Arrival ####
dg_de_stg2_pg1_para1=As before, during the taxi job to the dragons on ${dragonPlanet}, Karengo guides you down to a landing spot far away from the local government${ifPlayerOwnedWorld}. "Don't want any interruptions," he explains.
dg_de_stg2_pg1_para1_ifPlayerOwnedWorld=, despite your assurances that you control the local government
dg_de_stg2_pg1_para2=Despite days of pressuring, you've been unable to get Karengo to tell you exactly what a quoijuu is, other than a slightly ominous, "the biggest fish". He sends a file to your ship computer and grins. "Since it's too late to back out now, it's time to fill you in. Quoijuu aren't the only thing down there; you've also got scyllae, taniwhales, morgawrii, plus some hydrothermal vents, none of which we want to startle."
dg_de_stg2_pg1_para3="The good news is that there's a path to follow. The bad news is that the only person to make the path public was a nut. It's all in riddles, and part of the fun will be following your lead. And don't worry too much about it - what's the worst that could happen?"
dg_de_stg2_pg1_opt1="Ok, I'll take a look"
dg_de_stg2_pg1_opt2="We could get lost and then die"
dg_de_stg2_pg1_opt2_onSelected=Karengo pulls his face into a distant relative of a reassuring smile and says nothing.
dg_de_stg2_pg2_para1=The adventure seekers, who you've spent the trip getting to know, are getting ready. You watch a nearby pair, Daciana and Mussie, helping each other out to put on wetsuits, when Daciana catches your gaze and grins. "Bafta, mate. Safe sailing, see you on the other side." Karengo gives you a signal and you hurry back to the cockpit to fly out, away from safe shoals and over the watery abyss.
dg_de_stg2_pg2_para1_continue=Dive
dg_de_stg2_pg2_para2=At your touch, the ship slowly sinks below the waves. As Karengo warned you about on the way over, most of your navigation systems quickly flash red warnings and go offline; there is some unknown interference that overwhelms your ship's sensors, which were designed for space first and water second, or fifth, or not at all. Minutes tick by as the crew silently watches one of the few sensors still working. A young couple, Balazs and Jorma, uneasily exchange glances.
dg_de_stg2_pg2_opt1=Continue
dg_de_stg2_pg3_para1=EIGHT KILOMETERS, the depth meter reads.
dg_de_stg2_pg3_para1_2=TEN KILOMETERS.
dg_de_stg2_pg3_para1_3=SIXTEEN KILOMETERS. A loud, metallic creak echoes through the ship and Mussie jumps, startled.
dg_de_stg2_pg3_para2=Karengo claps him on the back and gives him a signature grin. "Maybe ${playerFirstName} can keep you aboard after this in case ${playerPronounHeShe} needs anything from a high shelf!" Mussie smiles weakly, but his eyes don't leave the readout.
dg_de_stg2_pg3_opt1=Continue
dg_de_stg2_pg4_para1=TWENTY-FIVE KILOMETERS. "This's it," Karengo announces, "Sub up! Let's see what there is to see. And ${playerFirstName}, keep it to passive sensors. Don't want to attract any undue attention." The ship smoothly descends into the mouth of a massive cave and your visibility, clouded by hydrothermal vent emissions, drops to less than eight meters. Six subpods fan out behind you, their communication equipment syncing with yours and displaying as blips on your screen.
dg_de_stg2_pg4_para2="Ok, ${playerFirstName}," Karengo crackles over the radio. "Lead on."

##### Riddle 1 #####
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_para1===No other path may you take\nOiled skins flash and flicker\nRazer spikes grow from the deep\nTitanic walls crush and smash\nHeed the beginnings to live.==
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_optEast=Go East
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_optNorth=Go North
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_optSouth=Go South
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_optWest=Go West
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_east_para1=Small schools of fish flit past as you guide your small fleet to the east. Out of the darkness, some sort of small whale crashes into your ship, setting off a couple of proximity alarms but causing no damage. It isn't until you hear screaming, distorted by the speakers, that it becomes clear what you just saw; the "small whale" was a just a flipper of something much, much larger.
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_east_para2="Morgawrii!" shouts Karengo, "Turn around! Turn around!"
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_east_opt1=Turn around
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_east_opt1_onSelected=Hauling on the controls, you spin your ship around. Leviathan shapes rise from below, stirring the water around your ship as it speeds to safety.
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_south_para1=Small schools of fish flit past as you guide your small fleet to the south. The swirling clouds of emissions get thicker and thicker, until there's no reason to look at anything but the ship compass. The screen beeps once and a blip disappears.
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_south_para2="Elias?" Karengo asks. "Your transmitter just cut out." When there's no response, he swears. "Everybody go back." he broadcasts. "Something's wrong."
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_south_opt1=Go back
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_south_opt1_onSelected=You spin your ship around and hear a loud crunch come from outside - your shields have impacted something large and solid. The outer lights shine off falling stone and it all comes together; you've led everybody through a field of hydrothermal vents that reach dozens of meters above the floor, obscured by their own noxious clouds. You guide your ship back to safety, toppling more underwater smokestacks as you go.
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_west_para1=Small schools of fish flit past as you guide your small fleet to the west. Minutes pass with no sign of danger, and finally Karengo broadcasts, "Good work, ${playerFirstName}. Looks like this is the way forward."
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_west_para2="Last one there's a rotten fish eye!" shouts Elias, and your screen shows his subpod leap forward and gain on you, followed quickly by Taddese'.
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_west_para3=Then, without warning, a proximity sensor goes off. The exterior lights show a wall directly in front of the ship, stretching for as far as you can see. "Stop!" shouts Karengo, "Stop and go back!"
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_west_opt1=Go back
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_west_opt1_onSelected=Shuttering, your ship comes to a halt mere meters from the stone face. With a sinking feeling that has nothing to do with the depth, you turn the ship around and head back the way you came.
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_failure_para1=A quick roll call shows two subpods missing; Elias and Taddese never made it back.
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_failure_para2=A voice crackles over the radio, "It's clear up north!" Somebody, no doubt unimpressed by your navigating, has scouted ahead and found a way though.
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_failure_opt1=Open the next riddle
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_north_para1=You turn the ship to the north and glide it through the abyssal depths. The subpods race forward, each vying to outdo the other, seemingly heedless of the dangers that Karengo hinted at. With bated breath, you watch the sensors until, at last, the comms flare.
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_north_para2="Woah!" comes Karengo's voice. "I think that's far enough. Which way to we go next, ${playerFirstName}?"
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_north_opt1=Open the next riddle
#
##### Riddle 2 #####
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_para1===There are stingers in the deep\nA certain death, a dreamless sleep.\nGo to beast that has no bee\nNo danger there, just open sea.==
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_optEast=Go East
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_optNorth=Go North
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_optWest=Go West
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_north_para1=Bubbles rush past the thick windows as the group's subpods scout to the north at your direction. At first, all is quiet. Just as you start to exhale a sigh of relief, twin lightning bolts arc across the waterscape ahead and the ship sensors overload, blinded by an apparent release of electricity. The systems recover, showing subpods returning quickly to the ship.
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_north_para2=One is missing; Mussie.
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_north_opt1=Go back
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_north_opt1_onSelected=You turn the ship back the way you came and pull up the sensor recording to see what happened. The flash of light came from viney seaweed, stretching as far up and down as the ship can detect. Evidently, contact with it released a jolt of electricity that lit up both the vine and Mussie's subpod.
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_west_1stWallCrash_para1=Small schools of fish flit past as you guide your small fleet to the west. Minutes pass with no sign of danger, and finally Karengo broadcasts, "Good work, ${playerFirstName}. Looks like this is the way forward."
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_west_1stWallCrash_para2="Last one there's a rotten fish eye!" shouts Mussie, and your screen shows his subpod leap forward and gain on you'.
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_west_1stWallCrash_para3=Then, without warning, a proximity sensor goes off. The exterior lights show a wall directly in front, stretching for as far as you can see. "Stop!" shouts Karengo, "Stop and go back!"
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_west_1stWallCrash_opt1=Go back
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_west_1stWallCrash_opt1_onSelected=Shuttering, your ship comes to a halt mere meters from the stone face. With a sinking feeling that has nothing to do with the depth, you turn the ship around and head back the way you came.
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_west_2ndWallCrash_para1=The proximity alarm wails and this time, you're much quicker to stop the ship. Mussie isn't so lucky. His subpod smashes straight into a different stretch of the same rock wall that claimed Elias and Taddese only minutes before.
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_west_2ndWallCrash_opt1=Go back
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_west_2ndWallCrash_opt1_onSelected=Again, you put the ship into reverse and turn around. This is not going at all how it was supposed to.
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_failure_firstFail_para1=Karengo sounds a roll call over the radio. Mussie never reports in, and his subpod beacon isn't responding. "Ah, well." says Karengo neutrally. "You all stay here and I'll scout ahead."
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_failure_firstFail_para2=Only minutes later, he's found a clear path east, and you morosly trail the ship behind.
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_failure_secondFail_para1=Karengo sounds a roll call over the radio. Elias and Taddese are still missing, and now Mussie has failed to report in as well. None of their subpod beacons are responding.
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_failure_secondFail_para2="Ah, well." says Karengo neutrally. "You all stay here and I'll scout ahead." Only minutes later, he's found a clear path east, and you morosly trail the ship behind.

#
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_east_firstSuccess_para1=Cautiously, you turn to the east and power forward. Subpods fly ahead, exulting in their agility in the face of the dangerous ocean.
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_east_firstSuccess_para2=After holding your breath for what feels like hours, Karengo radios you. "Knew you'd find your way eventually. What's the next direction?"
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_east_firstSuccess_opt1=Open the next riddle
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_east_secondSuccess_para1="A bee-less beast," you mutter to yourself. "A poet, this writer was not." Turning east, the ship powers forward, cautious but confident.
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_east_secondSuccess_para2=Subpods fly ahead, exulting in their agility in the face of the dangerous ocean. It isn't long until Karengo again radios you. "Knew I chose you for a reason. What's the next direction?"

#
##### Riddle 3 #####
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_para1===To the north and to the east\nTrack my movements like a beast.\nA quick turn right and forward on,\nCome toward me where danger's gone.==
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_optNorth=Go North
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_optEast=Go East
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_optSouth=Go South
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_north_quoijuu_para1_firstFail=Buoyed by your navigation thus far, you make the call to go north, completing the zig-zag pattern.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_north_quoijuu_para1_secondFail=Hesitantly, you make the call to go north, completing the zig-zag pattern.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_north_quoijuu_para1_thirdFail=Disheartened at this point, you make the call to go north, completing the zig-zag pattern.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_north_quoijuu_para2=The subpods, as usual, race ahead of the ship despite all logic. "Wall to the east!" calls out Daciana, whose beacon on the ship display starts to move north-west, presumably avoiding the undersea hazard while joining up with Jorma. "Hmm," radios in Karengo. "We should be right about on top of it. Send out a ping." It's almost a relief to send out a pulse to map the surroundings after flying dark for so long.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_north_quoijuu_para3=The result is not what you were hoping for. The display maps two leviathan-sized things ahead, each over 200 meters long. Dozens of sets of flippers run along each massive side and hundreds of teeth line their jaws.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_north_quoijuu_para4=You goggle at the display for a moment, taking it in, and draw breath to call out the alarm when an eye appears through the ship window; yellow, glowing, alien, and massive. All at once, you turn and accelerate, shouting the alarm to any who hadn't already realized, and hoping that you're leaving the leviathan beasts behind. A quick glance at the display shows at least one subpod following behind; good enough. If one of those rams the ship, nobody is going home anyway.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_north_quoijuu_para5=It's a long while before you slow and turn around. No mammoth sea monster comes out of the darkness, and you take a breath.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_north_quoijuu_para6="Quoijuu," says Karengo simply.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_north_quoijuu_opt1=Continue
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_east_wall_firstWallFail_para1=Small schools of fish flit past as you guide your small fleet to the east. Minutes pass with no sign of danger, and finally Karengo broadcasts, "Good work, ${playerFirstName}. Looks like this is the way forward."
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_east_wall_firstWallFail_para2="Last one there's a rotten fish eye!" shouts Jorma, and your screen shows his subpod leap forward and gain on you, followed quickly by others'.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_east_wall_firstWallFail_para3=Then, without warning, a proximity sensor goes off. The exterior lights show a wall directly in front, stretching for as far as you can see. "Stop!" shouts Karengo, "Stop and go back!"
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_east_wall_firstWallFail_opt1=Go back
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_east_wall_firstWallFail_opt1_onSelected=Shuttering, your ship comes to a halt mere meters from the stone face. With a sinking feeling that has nothing to do with the depth, you turn the ship around and head back the way you came.
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_east_wall_secondWallFail_para1=The proximity alarm wails and this time, you're much quicker to stop the ship...but your tracker shows two subpods smash straight into the stone wall looming in front of you.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_east_wall_secondWallFail_opt1=Go back
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_east_wall_secondWallFail_opt1_onSelected=Again, you put the ship into reverse and turn around. This is not going at all how it was supposed to.
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_east_wall_thirdWallFail_para1=By now, the proximity alarm is familiar to you, as is the solid wall rushing toward your already-slowing ship and the feeling as the ship's subpod tracker loses two more dots, leaving a single remaining subpod; Karengo's.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_east_wall_thirdWallFail_opt1=Go back
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_failure_para1=Jorma and Daciana never report back in.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_failure_para2="You stay." radios Karengo. He sounds frustrated for the first time, and you keep the ship in place, watching his subpod dot radiate outwards, exploring.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_failure_para3="Come here." he finally says. His dot has stopped moving, hovering to the south, and you turn to follow, wondering if this misadventure is finally over.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_failure_para4="It's here," radios Karengo. "Fire off a ping." You comply, and the display shows a massive object directly below you.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_failure_opt1=Continue
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_south_success_para1=You smoothly turn the ship to the right, heading south.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_south_success_para2="Should be close," radios Karengo. "Fire off a ping." It's a relief to send out a mapping ping after flying dark for so long.

dg_de_stg2_riddle3_south_success_para3=The result, however, is a surprise. The display shows a massive object directly below you...as well as as two leviathan-sized things back the way you came, each over 200 meters long. Dozens of sets of flippers run along each side and hundreds of teeth line their jaws.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_south_success_para4=You goggle at the display for a moment, holding your breath, but the leviathans seem uninterested. You shudder, imagining what one of those could do if you'd turned the wrong way, before your interest returns to the mysterious bulk resting below the ship.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_south_success_opt1=Continue
#
dg_de_stg2_viewTreasure_para1=A 3D holo floats on the console, displaying the smooth lines of a starship soaring down into the depths. The jagged edges suggest that this is only a part of a much larger vessel, although it's hard to guess at the size of the whole ship from the fragment.
dg_de_stg2_viewTreasure_para2=Your craft moves closer to investigate and you send out another ping, this time more focused, and the holographic ship display updates and refines. The outlines of sealed entrances are visible, unnecessary with the ship torn apart as it is. Sea growth is mostly absent from the hull, to your surprise, except for a radial pattern of some sort of crystal-shaped growth. Infrared imaging shows a dim glow of heat at its center.
dg_de_stg2_viewTreasure_para3_ifOthersSurvived="What we have here, folks," breaks in Karengo, "is a Gate Hauler. A chunk'o'one, anyway. And we're gonna take whatever we want. Let's see what there is to see."
dg_de_stg2_viewTreasure_para3_ifOnlyPlayerSurvived="What we have here, ${playerFirstName}," breaks in Karengo, "is a Gate Hauler. A chunk'o'one, anyway. And we're gonna take whatever we want. Let's see what there is to see."
dg_de_stg2_viewTreasure_para4=Now that active communication is low-risk, you bring up the video feed from Karengo's subpod as he floats toward the heat source. Bathed in floodlight, you can see that there are actual crystals formed on the ship hull, glowing a dull red.
dg_de_stg2_viewTreasure_para5_ifOthersSurvived=An unknowable something has rent a hole near the crystalline spiral, and Karengo disappears inside. The rest of the subpods wait outside, apparently spooked. "Jackpot!" comes his voice. "There's an AI core in here! ${playerFirstName}, get closer and let's get this out."
dg_de_stg2_viewTreasure_para5_ifOnlyPlayerSurvived=An unknowable something has rent a hole near the crystalline spiral, and Karengo disappears inside. "Jackpot!" comes his voice. "There's an AI core in here! ${playerFirstName}, get closer and let's get this out."
dg_de_stg2_viewTreasure_para6_ifAllOthersSurvived=It's slow work, but the group is able to cut loose the Beta Core, along with as much other salvage as possible. The crystalline growth covers everything inside the ship, making extraction difficult, but many hands make light work and you end up with a sizable haul. At last, you are done.
dg_de_stg2_viewTreasure_para6_ifSomeOthersSurvived=It's slow work, but the remains of the group are able to cut loose the Beta Core, along with as much other salvage as possible. The crystalline growth covers everything inside the ship, making extraction difficult, but many hands make light work and you end up with an acceptable haul. At last, you are done.
dg_de_stg2_viewTreasure_para6_ifOnlyPlayerSurvived=It's slow work, but you and Karengo are able to cut loose the Beta Core, along with as much other salvage as possible. The crystalline growth covers everything inside the ship, making extraction difficult. You wish there were others to help gather more salvage, but, at last, you are done.
dg_de_stg2_viewTreasure_opt1=Return to the surface
#
dg_de_stg2_backAtSurface_para1=Carefully, you navigate back to the surface, the knowledge that you've made it through once doing absolutely nothing to help with the very rational fear of the depths. Walls seem to loom just out of sight, and massive yellow eyes appear before dissolving into tricks of the light.
dg_de_stg2_backAtSurface_para2_ifOthersSurvived=It seems ages, but finally you break through to the surface. Karengo smiles, and a sigh of relief goes through the crew.
dg_de_stg2_backAtSurface_para2_ifOnlyPlayerSurvived=It seems ages, but finally you break through to the surface. Karengo smiles, but only you and he are left to be relieved.
dg_de_stg2_backAtSurface_para3="Alright," he says. "Let's get back to ==${depthsSourcePlanet}== in the ==${depthsSourceSystem}==. ${playerFirstName}, if you will."
dg_de_stg2_backAtSurface_opt1=Return to your fleet
dg_de_stg2_inSpace_para1=Once reunited with your fleet, a small flock of scientists haul the Beta Core to the engineering section for investigation. They quickly determine it to be non-functional but promise to extract as many secrets as possible.
dg_de_stg2_inSpace_opt1=Leave
dg_de_stg2_inSpace_salvaged_title=Salvaged
#
#### Stage 3: Return ####
dg_de_stg3_backToStart_pg1_para1=The crystal-infected Beta Core has been thoroughly inspected since being salvaged from the watery depths of ${depthsPlanet}.
dg_de_stg3_backToStart_pg1_para2_ifGatesAwakenedMidQuestNotDone=The storage units of the Core were almost entirely corrupted. The only decipherable information was related to Gate Codes, but didn't provide enough context to understand.
dg_de_stg3_backToStart_pg1_para2_ifFailedSomeRiddles=The storage units of the Core were almost entirely corrupted, but your fleet engineers were able to extract ==one gate code==.
dg_de_stg3_backToStart_pg1_para2_ifFailedNoRiddles=The storage units of the Core were almost entirely corrupted, but between your fleet engineers and the members of Karengo's crew, who, as adventurous people, had some amount of experience with Domain tech, ==two gate codes== were extracted.
dg_de_stg3_backToStart_pg1_para3=The crystals themselves are unlike anything anyone has seen before, but through somewhat questionable trial and error (although he insists it's genius), Karengo discovers that, when heated, they amplify the effect of the many recreational drugs he has on his person.
dg_de_stg3_backToStart_pg1_para4=However, they've proven to only grow near a power source that has been submerged in water from ${depthsPlanet}. Efforts to stimulate growth through other means have all failed.
dg_de_stg3_backToStart_pg1_para5===If cultivated, they could significantly boost the effective production of drugs back on ${depthsPlanet}.==
dg_de_stg3_backToStart_pg1_para6=Before disappearing into the crowd, Karengo paid you ==${depthsCreditReward}==.
dg_de_stg3_backToStart_pg1_opt1=Leave
