#### Stage 1: Bar Event ####
riley_stg1_prompt=A young woman is moving from captain to captain, looking for transport.
riley_stg1_startBarEvent=Ask the young woman where she needs to get to
riley_stg1_pg1_para1="I need to get to ==${rileyDestPlanet}== to see my father. He's dying. I have ==${rileyCredits}== to pay for the journey; please, will you help me? I need to be there in ==${rileyTimeLimitDays}== days, at the most."
riley_stg1_pg1_para2=Her eyelids are baggy, her clothes wrinkled, and she holds herself rigidly.
riley_stg1_pg1_para3=Your TriPad shows that ${rileyDestPlanet} in the ${rileyDestSystem} is ==${rileyDestPlanetDistanceLY} LY== away and controlled by ${rileyDestPlanetControllingFaction}.
riley_stg1_pg1_opt1="I can help you. We'll have to burn to reach ${rileyDestPlanet} in time."
riley_stg1_pg1_opt1_onSelected=Her eyes widen, and she opens her mouth twice before words come out. "Thank you! This means the world to me. My name is Riley, by the way. I don't have much luggage; I'll be ready to leave as soon as you are."
riley_stg1_pg1_opt1_onSelected_continue=Return to the bar
riley_stg1_pg1_opt2="With that much money, why not buy your own ship?"
riley_stg1_pg1_opt2_onSelected="I wouldn't know how to fly it, and I don't have time to learn. Please, can you help or not?"
riley_stg1_pg1_opt3="I don't have time to take on a passenger right now." (leave)
riley_stg1_pg1_opt3_onSelected=She nods, and moves to beseech another captain.
#
#### Stage 2: After days pass ####
riley_stg2_pg1_para1=In the days since Riley came aboard, she has relaxed and cleaned up. She looks nearly unrecognizable from the tired, desperate woman you first saw.
riley_stg2_pg1_para2=On the way, she told you stories of her past, mostly of time shared with her father.\nAs a young teen, they spent summers riding horse mechs through the forest, looking for beehives to steal honey from;\nAt age 19, she broke her ankle hoverboarding a restricted mountain peak. Her father rescued her, avoiding the police to hike up with a medical kit;\n\nShe talks about his wild birthday gifts to her each year, always a different piece of clothing with embedded AI that was just beyond what was technically allowed by law.\n\nAs you watch, she shows how her shirt warms and constricts if it detects stress, mimicking a hug.
riley_stg2_pg1_para3=She doesn't mention it, but it is clear she is concerned that she'll arrive too late to say goodbye.
riley_stg2_pg1_opt1=Close
#
#### Stage 3: Arrival in system ####
riley_stg3_pg1_para1=As you neared the ${rileyDestSystem}, Riley told you about the last time she saw her father. He had become focused on his work - research into safer sentient AI - and they hadn't seen each other for years. She had become a well-known DJ back on ${rileyOriginPlanet} and had a break in her touring schedule, so she spent a good chunk of her savings to visit him. They spent most of a month together, reliving old times.
riley_stg3_pg1_para2=He'd cried when it was time to leave, and she had, too, but life went on, and it was years before she heard from him again. His message was short and heart-wrenching. "Ri, please come as soon as you can. I may not have long, and wish to hold your hand one more time. All love, Dad."
riley_stg3_pg1_opt1=Close
#
#### Stage 4: Landed ####
riley_stg4_pg1_para1=Riley directs you to a pad near her old home, and you land the shuttle. She starts toward the door, then pauses and turns around with a self-conscious, but oddly sad, chuckle.
riley_stg4_pg1_para2="Right - your payment. ==${rileyCredits}==, as I promised."
riley_stg4_pg1_opt1_ifPaid="Thank you. Do you think I could come along? I've heard so much about your father."
riley_stg4_pg1_opt1_ifNotPaid="Do you think I could come along? I've heard so much about your father."
riley_stg4_pg1_opt2="This is a lot of credits for a trip. Does DJing pay that well?"
riley_stg4_pg1_opt2_onSelected="Not really, no. Honestly, this is most of my savings...but...it's my dad."
riley_stg4_pg1_opt3="Hold on to the credits. I'm a captain; I can always make more."
riley_stg4_pg1_opt3_onSelected=After a moment of stunned silence, she manages a choked "Thank you." You notice her eyes are brimming with tears.
riley_stg4_pg1_opt4="Thank you, and good luck." (leave)
riley_stg4_pg2_para1=She is taken aback at first, but agrees to let you join, and you wind your way away from the landing pads, across rural, wooded countryside, and finally to a modest house nestled along a valley edge. Riley knocks, and the door swings open.
riley_stg4_pg2_para2=Her father is in a comfortable-looking medical cradle. Wires flow from it to the holoscreens around the room, showing vitals and other indecipherable information. Despite his wan, strained face and atrophied body, he raises his head to look at his daughter.
riley_stg4_pg2_para3="Ri," he says, face lighting up. "My love. You cannot know how happy it makes me to see you. And you have company, I see. My name's Church."
riley_stg4_pg2_opt1="Riley chartered a flight here aboard my ship. I heard so much about you on the way; it's a pleasure to meet you."
riley_stg4_pg2_opt2="Riley and I have gotten to know each other on the long flight here. You've raised an incredible woman."
riley_stg4_pg2_opt2_onSelected="${playerFirstName} was the only captain willing to fly to the ${rileyDestSystem}. I wouldn't have made it here without ${playerPronounHimHer}," she says.
riley_stg4_pg3_para1=He smiles at you, acknowledging your part in their reunion with an appreciative nod.
riley_stg4_pg3_para2_ifGovtInvolved=You swap stories for hours, flowing between reminiscing over old times and catching up on their lives over the past few years. You learn that since he was young, Church researched AI that cannot develop into a threat; a project that the ${rileyDestPlanetControllingFaction} has been quietly interested in.
riley_stg4_pg3_para2_ifGovtNotInvolved=You swap stories for hours, flowing between reminiscing over old times and catching up on their lives over the past few years. You learn that since he was young, he'd been researching AI that cannot develop into a threat.
riley_stg4_pg3_para3=Riley, in turn, had always surrounded herself with music, and moved to ${rileyOriginPlanet} to share her passion with other like-minded people. You talk about what it's like to call a ship your home, leaving behind everything you grew up knowing and embracing life as a spacer.
riley_stg4_pg3_para4=Finally, her father lies back. "Well, thank you for making the trip out to see your old man. I...have to go now, I think. Don't forget about me, hear? And," Church hesitates for a moment, "whatever happens, please don't think ill of me. I will always love you."
riley_stg4_pg3_para5=His body relaxes, and he's gone.
riley_stg4_pg3_opt1=Take a seat
riley_stg4_pg3_opt1_onSelected=You take a seat, feeling the emotion of the moment wash over you as Riley silently weeps. Minutes go by, unnoticed.
riley_stg4_pg3_opt2=Comfort her
riley_stg4_pg3_opt2_onSelected=You hold Riley as she silently weeps. Time goes by, but neither of you pay it any mind.
riley_stg4_pg4_para1=Without warning, you hear Church's voice from a corner of the room. It's coming from an AI Core, held aloft by hundreds of cables dangling from the ceiling.
riley_stg4_pg4_para2="It...worked." He sounds shocked. Riley's head whips around, and you reflexively move your hand toward your holstered gun. "Please, don't be alarmed. I've been working on a personal project for over a decade now. My mind was uploaded to the modified Core you're looking at. I had to say goodbye - I couldn't know if it would work. You can't upload a mind while it's still alive. I tried that many times."
riley_stg4_pg4_opt1="Is this ...legal?"
riley_stg4_pg4_opt1_onSelected_ifIllegal_para1="Well, no." His voice distorts briefly before stabilizing. "Not under ${rileyDestPlanetControllingFaction} law. But I assure you that my intention is only to continue my work; nothing more."
riley_stg4_pg4_opt1_onSelected_ifIllegal_para2=You recall that local laws grant a ==${rileyBountyCredits} reward== for turning in a mind upload.
riley_stg4_pg4_opt1_onSelected_ifLegal="Here?" he replies. "There's no law against it. My only intention is to continue my work; nothing more."
riley_stg4_pg4_opt2="Riley, what do you think?"
riley_stg4_pg4_opt2_onSelected_para1="Dad, is that really you? How do you feel?"
riley_stg4_pg4_opt2_onSelected_para2=She steps closer to the Core, and they talk for a few tentative minutes, and then half an hour. As far as you can tell, the mind that she is talking to is indistinguishable from the man you came to meet.
riley_stg4_pg4_opt2_onSelected_para3=Finally, she turns to you. "It really is my dad. It's a lot to get used to, but...how many people get a second chance to spend time with their father before he's gone? Thank you for bringing me out here, and for coming. I'll never forget your part in this. For now, I'd like to stay here. You go - I'll find my way back."
riley_stg4_pg4_opt3="Are you sure? There's enough room for all of us on my ship. You can stay for as long as you want."
riley_stg4_pg4_opt3_onSelected="It's a nice idea," she smiles, "but I'm not a starfarer. The big city is where I'll end back up, eventually."
riley_stg4_pg4_opt4=Say goodbye (leave)
riley_stg4_pg4_opt4_onSelected_para1=Respecting Riley's request to stay with her father, you make your farewells and head for the door.
riley_stg4_pg4_opt4_onSelected_ifRomanced=She catches your hand and pulls you in for a quick peck on the cheek, then a soft punch on the chest. "Stay safe up there, ok?", she says, glancing skyward.
riley_stg4_pg4_opt4_onSelected_para2=You can feel her smile on your back until the door closes behind you. You catch yourself smiling as well, as you make your way back to your shuttle and return to the stars.
riley_stg4_pg4_opt5=Draw your gun and destroy the Core
riley_stg4_pg4_opt5_onSelected_para1=You advance on the Core and start firing at it. Church begs for you to stop until his voice cuts off. Lights on the Core turn from white to red, then fade. Riley hasn't moved, stunned.
riley_stg4_pg4_opt5_onSelected_para2=You head back to your shuttle, leaving behind a father survived by his daughter; no more and no less than nature intended.
riley_stg4_pg4_opt6=Turn the Core in for a ${rileyBountyCredits} bounty
riley_stg4_pg4_opt6_onSelected_para1=You say your goodbyes and leave. From across the street, you make a call to the local ${rileyDestPlanetControllingFactionWithoutArticle} office, and watch as they descend on the house.
riley_stg4_pg4_opt6_onSelected_para2=Your TriPad dings, and you can see that ==${rileyBountyCredits}== have been added to your account. Turning away, you head back to your shuttle.
riley_stg4_pg4_opt7_sierra="Sierra, your thoughts?"
riley_stg4_pg4_opt7_sierra_onSelected_para1=Sierra's avatar spins uncertainly in your vision. $c:#CD9BFF{"Well, it's kind of sad, isn't it? A human mind, squished into a Beta Core? Are you...still you, with such a confining substrate?"}
riley_stg4_pg4_opt7_sierra_onSelected_para2=Her spinning smooths out. $c:#CD9BFF{"They do seem really happy, though!"}
